class AccountActivationsController < ApplicationController
  
  # the standard REST practice is to issue a PATCH request to the update action. The activation
  # link needs to be sent in an email, though, and hence will involve a regular browser click, 
  # which issues a GET request instead of PATCH. This design constraint means that we canâ€™t use the update action.
