class AccountActivationsController < ApplicationController
  
  # the standard REST practice is to issue a PATCH request to the update action. The activation
  # link needs to be sent in an email, though, and hence will involve a regular browser click, 
  # which issues a GET request instead of PATCH. This design constraint means that we canâ€™t use the update action.

    # Example: With a service 
    # user = ActivateUser.execute(params)
    # if user.present?
    #   flash[:success] = "Account activated!"
    #   redirect_to user
    # else
    #   flash[:danger] = "Invalid activation link"
    #   redirect_to root_url
    # end
    # Example: With a module
    # user = User.find_by(email: params[:email])
    # if user.activate(params[:id])
    #   flash[:success] = "Account activated!"
    #   redirect_to user
